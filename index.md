# Pipe Hopper


## Overview
**Created by:** Manchester United Seven (102103151: Agam | 102103165: Umang Srivastava)

The aim of this project is to create an interactive game in which your mission is to navigate bird through a series of obstacles, all while maintaining a delicate balance between gravity and flight. Get ready to flap those wings, dodge pipes, and aim for the sky!!Because sometimes, all you need is a little bird with big dreams to remind you that the sky’s the limit.

## The Storyboard

## Project in Detail

**Static Parts:** 
The static parts of the animation include:
- The sun.

**Dynamic Parts:** 
The dynamic parts of the animation include:
- Pipe
- Moving Bird
- Movement of clouds 

**Rationale:**
- Engagement: The static elements set the stage for the 
interaction, while the dynamic parts create engagement 
by allowing the user to participate actively in the animation.
- The dynamic nature provides immediate feedback
to the user's actions, enhancing the interactive experience.
- Reward System: The score serves as a 
reward for dodging the pipes and encouraging gamers to 
maintain a delicate balance between gravity and flight of bird.

**Story and Problem Solving:**
The game simulates the challenges faced by a small bird navigating through a series of obstacles. The player’s task is to keep the bird airborne by tapping the spacebar or mouse click, avoiding collisions with pipes, and aiming for the highest score. The game should strike a balance between simplicity and precision.

Challenges faced include:
- Bird Shape: Designing a bird sprite that feels natural, visually appealing, and responsive.
- Challenge: Creating dynamic cloud movement that adds depth to the game.
