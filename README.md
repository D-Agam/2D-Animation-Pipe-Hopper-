## Logistics ##
+ A submission is admissible *only* using a thapar.edu
  account.
+ Candidates **are encouraged** to sensibly use
  external resources and duly acknowledge them using
  citations, *e.g.*  geometry definitions for a
  tranformation exercise.  Failure to cite an external
  resource shall be tantamount to plagiarism.
+ The deadlines are soft in the sense, that a delayed
  submission is admissible, albeit with **a penalty**
  of 30% rounded away from zero.
+ **To update your identity**: Modify your name and
  roll number on `experiment.js`, *eg.*

  ```javascript
  class Experiment {
    // Candidate Details
    static rollNo = '10983743'
    static name = 'The Tutor'

    // ...
  }
  ```
  And it shall reflect on the top right of your page
  like:
  
  ![](./assets/name-roll-example.png)
+ **To save the canvas**: The top right of the canvas
  is overlaid with a download button for quick capture
  of the canvas.  This is better than Canvas >
  Right-click > "Save to image..." in that the filename
  contains roll number and submission code by default.
+ **To hide/reveal the controls UI:** Visibility of the
  controls UI may be toggled inside
  `Experiment.constructor` (generally in
  `experiment.js`) as follows,

  ```javascript
  class Experiment {
    // ...
    constructor() {
      //...

      // Uncomment to enable tranform controls
      // --------------------------------------------------
      this.controls.unhide()

      //...
    }
  }
  ```
  This shall reveal the controls on the page, as
  follows,
  ![](./assets/controls-example.png)
+ Any unethical practices (like plagiarism etc.)
  **shall be taken seriously**.
