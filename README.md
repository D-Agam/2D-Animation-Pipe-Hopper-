# UCS505 Lab Project
(Jan 2024)

**Update: 2 Apr 2024**

After careful consideration to be in sync with the
other groups' workload, your assignments have been
restructured as follows:

There will be only one project evaluated to 15 marks,
to be submitted in groups of 2 or 3 students as a
mandatory requirement.

Further details of the problem statement, logistics and
evaluation criteria will be updated later.

Hence, [the earlier list of
assignments](./README.orig.md) are **null and void**
